========================================

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course in the Data Science Coursera specialization offered through John's Hopkins University.  

About the data used in this project
-----------------------------------

The data for this project were obtained from University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. More information about the data used can be found here

If you wish to replicate the results of this script and output a TidyData.txt of your own, you must first download the data

About the script and data set
-----------------------------

In this directory are the script run_analysis.R, the CodeBook.md, and the output TidyData.txt dataset
The R script contains code to pull in the raw data from the UCI data set, merge it, clean it, summarize it, and output it as TidyData.txt

The use the script:

1. clone the repo and cd into this directory. 
2. Set the DataFolder and OutputFolder to your maching file paths as neccessary. 
3. Run the script and observe the TidyData.txt

View the CodeBook.md for more information about the data in TidyData.txt
