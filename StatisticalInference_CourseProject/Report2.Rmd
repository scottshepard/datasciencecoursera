```{r, echo=FALSE}
  library(ggplot2)
```

This is the second of two reports for the Statistical Inference Course Project.

Load the ToothGrowth Dataset and view the first few rows.
```{r}
  data(ToothGrowth)
  head(ToothGrowth)
  summary(ToothGrowth)
```

Do some exploratory analysis on the set.  
1. What does the distrubtion of dose by supplement type look like?  
2. Does does of supplment have any correlation with tooth length?
```{r}
  with(ToothGrowth, table(supp, dose))
```
So there were 10 Guinna Pigs at each dose and supplement.

```{r}
  ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, y=len, color=supp)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~ dose)

```  
So the dose level does have an effect on tooth length. And it seems like OJ 
supplement has greater tooth lengths at the 0.5 and 1.0 doses but not at the 2.0 level.
